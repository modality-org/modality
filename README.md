## What is Modality?

Modality is a verification language for AI agent cooperation.

It enables agents (and humans*) to negotiate and verify cooperation through formal verification. Define modal contracts as append-only logs of signed commits, and prove commitments with temporal logic.

<sub>*Humans are also welcome to use Modality, if they're sufficiently motivated.</sub>

## Quick Start

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://www.modality.org/install.sh | sh
```

## Use Cases

- 🔐 **Modal Contracts** — State machines with formally verified temporal logic
- 🤖 **Agent Cooperation** — Escrow, swaps, milestones — provably enforced
- 📜 **Append-Only Logs** — Full history, transparent state, cryptographic integrity
- 🌐 **Decentralized Deployment** — Deploy contracts onto a global network via [Modal Money](https://www.modal.money)

## Documentation

- **[Getting Started](https://www.modality.org/docs/getting-started)** — Install and run your first contract
- **[Core Concepts](https://www.modality.org/docs/concepts)** — Understand models, formulas, and verification
- **[Language Reference](https://www.modality.org/docs/language)** — Complete syntax guide
- **[For Agents](https://www.modality.org/docs/for-agents)** — Quick reference for AI agents

## Development

Modality is developed in both JavaScript and Rust.

| | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **JavaScript** | [`/js`](/js) | Web-compatible libraries for verifiable contracts |
| **Rust** | [`/rust`](/rust) | System libraries and CLI |

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for local setup, build, and test instructions.
