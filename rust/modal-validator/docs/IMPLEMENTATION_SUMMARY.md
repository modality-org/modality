### Key Components

#### Narwhal Layer

**Purpose**: High-throughput transaction dissemination using a Certified DAG

**Components**:
- `Worker`: Collects transactions, forms batches, shares with other workers
- `Primary`: Creates headers referencing batches, collects votes, forms certificates
- `DAG`: Stores certificates, maintains parent-child relationships, detects equivocations
- `Certificate`: Contains header + aggregated signature (quorum of 2f+1 votes)

**Key Properties**:
- Certified DAG structure (each node has 2f+1 signatures)
- Parallel transaction dissemination across workers
- Causal ordering via parent references
- Byzantine fault tolerance via quorum certificates

#### Shoal Layer

**Purpose**: Fast, responsive consensus on the Narwhal DAG

**Components**:
- `ShoalConsensus`: Core consensus logic, anchor selection, commit rules
- `ReputationManager`: Tracks validator performance, selects leaders
- `OrderingEngine`: Topologically sorts committed certificates for deterministic transaction order
- `ConsensusState`: Tracks current round, committed certificates, anchors

**Key Properties**:
- **1-round pipelining**: One anchor per round for continuous commits
- **Reputation-based leader selection**: Dynamic leader election based on performance
- **Prevalent responsiveness**: No timeouts in normal operation
- **Byzantine fault tolerance**: Tolerates f < n/3 Byzantine validators

### Data Flow

## Performance Summary

### Key Metrics (4-validator network)

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Certificate Formation | 0.90µs | < 1µs | ✅ Excellent |
| Consensus Processing | 5.17µs | < 10µs | ✅ Excellent |
| DAG Insertion | 0.89µs | < 5µs | ✅ Excellent |
| Leader Selection | 1.04µs | < 5µs | ✅ Excellent |
| End-to-End Round | 249µs | < 1ms | ✅ Excellent |

### Throughput Estimates

**Single-Core Performance**:
- **4 validators**: ~166K certificates/second
- **7 validators**: ~111K certificates/second
- **10 validators**: ~71K certificates/second

**Multi-Round Throughput** (with pipelining):
- **4 validators**: ~4K certificates/second (40 certs per 10 rounds)
- **7 validators**: ~2K certificates/second (70 certs per 10 rounds)

### Scalability

| Operation | Complexity | 4→16 validators |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Certificate Formation | O(n) | 3.5x slower |
| Consensus Processing | O(n) | ~4.5x slower |

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ **4-10 validators**: Optimal performance across all operations

## Security Analysis

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance

**Tolerance**: f < n/3 Byzantine validators

**Properties**:
- ✅ **Safety**: No two honest validators commit conflicting certificates
- ✅ **Liveness**: Honest validators make progress if >2f+1 honest validators are online
- ✅ **Accountability**: Equivocating validators can be detected and punished

**Mechanisms**:
- **Quorum Certificates**: 2f+1 signatures ensure Byzantine agreement
- **Equivocation Detection**: Multiple certificates from same author at same round detected
- **Path Validation**: Commit rule ensures causal consistency
- **Reputation Isolation**: Poor-performing validators lose leadership probability

### Attack Resistance

**Tested Scenarios**:
- ✅ Byzantine minority (f validators) attempting conflicting commits → Isolated
- ✅ Equivocating validators → Detected
- ✅ Poor-performing leaders → Replaced via reputation
- ✅ Concurrent processing → Thread-safe with proper locking

**Known Limitations**:
- Network-level attacks (DDoS, eclipse) not yet implemented
- Economic attacks (bribery) require incentive layer
- Long-range attacks require checkpointing mechanism
