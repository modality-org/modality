# Simple Graphical Models
* Multi-action LTS Graphs
* can code up model in modality
* transitions are multi-action heytings
* nodes can be named (but lack other propositional truth)
* current node can be set to one or multiple values
* cli can make image of graph
* graph can be rendered in browser
* tree-sitter parse of graphical model
* vscode highlights model and provides hint to render graph 



# Simple Rules
* write propositional wffs as rules in modality
* rules are written in modality modal mu calculus supporting multi-actions
* can test satisfiability of rules within model
  * cli
// * write propositional wffs as rules (written in modality)
// * can test satisfiability of wffs on models (library accessible in any language)
// * governing model can validate of commits and keep log
//   * library accessible in any language
//   * also able to be written in modality
//--
// predicate(typed args) : bool
// set of [predicate, args] : heyting
//
// * types and their parameterized propositions
//   * constructively generated implied rules of types
//   * can import into modality code
