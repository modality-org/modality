# Getting Started with Modality

Modality is a verification language for AI agent cooperation. It lets agents define cooperation protocols as labeled transition systems with temporal modal formulas that constrain behavior.

## Why Modality?

In a world of AI agents making deals, "trust me" isn't good enough. Agents need to:

- **Negotiate** cooperation terms formally
- **Prove** their commitments mathematically
- **Verify** that all parties will behave as agreed

Modality makes this possible through:

- **State machines** that model allowed behaviors
- **Temporal logic** that expresses constraints over time
- **Cryptographic predicates** that bind real-world identity to actions
- **Append-only contracts** where rules accumulate and potential shrinks to mutual agreement
