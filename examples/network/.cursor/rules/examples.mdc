- write each example to teach users how to use the modal CLI.
- also make sure each example can also be run as a integration test, use test.sh in each example directory to run the tests.
- write a README.md file in each example directory that explains the example and how to run it.
- assume that command `modal` is available in the path, do not explicitly reference a path to find it. when testing assume that the modal binary that will take precedence in the path is the one that is in the rust/target/debug directory.
  - for example, do not write `../../../rust/target/debug/modal` in the examples, just write `modal`.
- when creating new tests, follow the pattern of the existing tests. 01-ping-node/, 04-sync-miner-blocks/, etc. Use a test.sh file to run all the tests in the example. Each test should be modular and self-contained but valuable to sequentially test the entire example suite. 
- tmp/ is a temporary directory for the tests to use. It is gitignored. It is used to store the nodes and other resources for the tests.
- while creating a node, use the modal node create command to create the node. It will create a node in the tmp/ directory.
- use devnet1 as the default network for all examples unless otherwise specified.
