# Documentation File Placement

When creating documentation files about implementation progress, features, summaries, or status updates, place them in `docs/progress/` rather than the project root.

## Files that should go in docs/progress/:
- Implementation documentation: `*_IMPLEMENTATION*.md`
- Summary documents: `*_SUMMARY.md`
- Completion reports: `*_COMPLETE*.md`
- Status updates: `*_STATUS.md`
- Command documentation: `*_COMMAND*.md`
- Architecture documentation: `*_ARCHITECTURE*.md`
- Feature documentation: `*_FEATURE*.md`
- Verification reports: `*_VERIFICATION*.md`
- Progress reports: `*_PROGRESS.md`
- Phase completion: `*_PHASE*.md`
- Test results: `*_RESULTS.md`
- Any other progress/implementation tracking documents

## Files that should stay in the project root:
- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- DEVELOPMENT.md
- LICENSE
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- Other standard project documentation

## Examples

✅ **Correct placement:**
- `docs/progress/WASM_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
- `docs/progress/ASSET_MANAGEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `docs/progress/CONSENSUS_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md`

❌ **Incorrect placement:**
- `WASM_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (in root)
- `ASSET_MANAGEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (in root)

## Implementation

When creating any progress or implementation tracking document:
1. Save it directly to `docs/progress/` with the appropriate filename
2. Use descriptive names that include keywords like IMPLEMENTATION, SUMMARY, COMPLETE, STATUS, etc.
3. Keep the project root clean with only essential project documentation

This organization keeps the project root clean and makes it easier to find standard project documentation in the root while progress tracking documents are organized in docs/progress/.
